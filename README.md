Double Harvard with arithmetic shifts










1 Memory Architecture 







a) Architecture: Harvard






â€¢ Harvard Architecture is the digital computer architecture whose design is based on the concept
where there are separate storage and separate buses (signal path) for instruction and
data. It was basically developed to overcome the bottleneck of Von Neumann Architecture.







b) Instruction Memory Size: 1024 * 16
